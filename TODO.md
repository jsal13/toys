# TODO

These are things I need to do.

- Debug `aws_sns_cloudwatch`.

- Audit `log_grafana` and see what I need to do with that noise.
- Is opentelemetry worth doing something with?
- [Composition of docker compose files][1]
- README use <>'s to make things links.
- Refactor `make_example_table.py`.  This should be a lot easier to use.
- `justfiles` to combine things.
- Redo prefect, just because I don't remember doing it.
- Copy over Trino and use something like Hive Metastore / Postgres / Whatever else.
- Do Airflow with helm. <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html>
