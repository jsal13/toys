# TODO

These are things I need to do.

- Make an aggregation table for Kafka, so that prefect can add to that.
- Trino should also be able to query something else?
- Grafana.
- Debug `aws_sns_cloudwatch`.
- Audit `K8s_helm_sample_chart` to work with k3d.
- Audit `log_grafana` and see what I need to do with that noise.
- Copy over Trino and use something like Hive Metastore / Postgres / Whatever else.
- Do Airflow with helm. <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/helm-chart/stable/index.html>
